# Calculator Project

I am trying to learn the Tkinter Library in order to expand my knowledge in Python. 
Thus, I decided to follow along a Codemy.com tutorial on Tkinter for this project.
Upon completion of the Tutorial, I decided to test what I learned by modifying the code
to fit what I envisioned of a calculator. There is still a lot of small things in the 
code that don't make sense as this is my very first Tkinter project, but I am hoping
to continue learning and improve upon this code in the future. However for now, this 
is the final code.
